# Scraper Framework
A fully-customizable framework for Python web scrapers with examples.

## Features 
This framework lays the groundwork to make a Python web scraper. A scraper for a single webpage can be created in minutes with just the inbuilt helper functions. You can also create your own custom scraping routines.
It uses chromedriver headless by defualt but the method can be overridden to whatever method you require.

## Examples 
This repository contains two examples for two different websites; Lowes and Menards both store pages. There are driver programs to run these scrapers as well.
